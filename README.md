# Echorama - Capture the world
Turn your FFXIV snapshots into sweeping scenic views—effortlessly capture the grandeur of Eorzea.

## Dislaimer: 
* Echorama allows you to create immersive panorama screenshots inside FFXIV.  
* It automates the process of capturing multi-angle screenshots and stitching them into a wide panorama view.  
* It was initially only meant for the creator of the [Eorguessr](https://eorguessr.com/) game to allow him/her to generate panoramas in a faster and more reliable way, it evolved from there.

## Installation
