# Echorama - Capture the world

Echorama allows you to create immersive panorama screenshots inside FFXIV.  
It automates the process of capturing multi-angle screenshots and stitching them into a wide panorama view.  
It was initially only meant for the creator of the eorguessr game to allow him/her to generate panoramas in a faster and more reliable way, it evolved from there.
